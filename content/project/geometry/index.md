Computational Geometry Course, March 2021, M.Sc. in Computer Science @UniMi

## About the project
{{< figure src="img.png" caption="Icosahedron obtained with the application." numbered="true" >}}

The aims of this project were to study how tessellation works with simple domains and to
implement the basic logic for triangulating the vertices of simple
objects like cubes and then more complex ones like tori, spheres, and cylinders.

For the course project, a report was also produced in the form of a <a
    href="http://www.mat.unimi.it/users/alzati/Geometria_Computazionale_98-99/apps/trietas/index.html">website</a>
(fully in <i>Italian</i>), hosted by the university's mathematics department <i>Federigo Enriques</i>. It contains
the theory behind the software, the techniques involved, a user manual for the application, and many example videos.

It is possible to download the source code of the project from the <a
    href="https://github.com/manuelpagliuca/Computational_Geometry_2021">GitHub Repository</a> by
following this link. The course was a complete math course and the project was developed using the
**OpenGL** specification.

*"has developed the project related to the triangulation and tessellation of the lateral
    surface of some geometric solids obtaining truly amazing visual effects."* - Prof. Alzati
