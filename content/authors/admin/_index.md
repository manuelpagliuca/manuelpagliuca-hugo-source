Hello! 👋🏻 I am Manuel, a 29-year-old Software Engineer. 

Since early age I've passion for computers and videogames.

During my journey I developed a strong interest in many fields of this science, my favorites are the following:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Distributed Systems**
- **Computer Graphics**
- **AI & AI4V**
- **Computer Vision**

For this reason, I am a passionate programmer, in that what I love to do most is to design solutions that effectively address problems and then improve their performance. I have worked with several programming languages and see them as tools to help the programmer implement the actual solution, I do not see them as the end goal.

This corner of the internet is dedicated to a portfolio showcasing my academic and professional journey. However, it's important to emphasize that this space is not solely about serving as a portfolio. It's also a place where I share personal projects, images, posts, and resources.

In my leisure time, I take pleasure in activities such as running, weightlifting, reading, and playing the guitar. As passions tend to evolve with time, who knows what the future has in store for me? 🌌
