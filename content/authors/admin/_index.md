Hello! 👋🏻 I am Manuel, a 27-year-old computer scientist who recently completed my Master's degree 🎓 (09/10/2023). I chose to pursue a master's degree to broaden my horizons in the field of Computer Science, while gaining valuable practical experience through internships in the working world.

I am currently working on tidying up some things in my life; I do not yet have an occupation.

I've always had a deep passion for computer programming and the world related to it. I've developed a strong interest in many fields, in particular:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Distributed Systems**
- **Computer Graphics**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Computer Vision**

For this reason, I am a passionate programmer, in that what I love to do most is to design solutions that effectively address problems and then improve their performance. I have worked with several programming languages and see them as tools to help the programmer implement the actual solution, I do not see them as the end goal.

This corner of the internet is dedicated to a portfolio showcasing my academic and professional journey. However, it's important to emphasize that this space is not solely about serving as a portfolio. It's also a place where I share personal projects, images, posts, and resources.

In my leisure time, I take pleasure in activities such as running, weightlifting, reading, and playing the guitar. As passions tend to evolve with time, who knows what the future has in store for me? 🌌
